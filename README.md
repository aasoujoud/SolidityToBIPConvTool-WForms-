# SolidityToBIPConvTool-WForms-
Tool to convert Solidity to BIP 
#SOL-to-BIP tool -version 0.3

#This program utilized Object-oriented language C# 
#to develop a program that models single and composite smart contracts written in Solidity to the BIP language


Before using this tool, please follow the instructions:
-Keep each bracket on a separate line.
-Conditional statements must all be on separate lines.


Exceptions: (Solidity syntax that are not covered)
-The constructor is not supported.
-The modifier is not supported.
-Contract title must only contain contract and the name of the contract (Ex. Contract ContractName{).
-Require, Delegatecall, etc should all be on the same line.


This is not the final project, this is the first unenhanced and vanila version of the project. You may use any of the provided smart contracts (under folders CompositeSmartContracts, OnlineExamples, or SimpleSmartContract), or use the website etherscan.io and try publicly shared contracts, but always keep in mind to follow the above rules.
